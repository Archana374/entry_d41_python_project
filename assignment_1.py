# Write Python code that prints yourname, student number and emailaddress.
# Exercise 1: Prints name, student number, and email address
# print("archana  ST1001 archana@gmail.com")
# Exercise 2: Prints name, student number, and email address using escape sequences
# print("archana  ST1001 archana@gmail.com")
# Exercise 3: Add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers (14 and 7)
# Exercise 4: Displays the numbers from 1 to 5 as steps
#  for i in range(1,6):
#  print(i)
# Exercise 5: Outputs the sentence with quotes and line break
# print("\"SDK\" stands for \"Software Development Kit\", whereas \"IDE\" stands for \"Integrated Development Environment\".")
# Exercise 6: Practice with escape sequences
# print("python is an \"awesome\" language.")
# print("python\n\t2023")
# print('I\'m from Entri.\b')
# print("\65")  # ASCII value of '5'
# print("\x65")  # Hexadecimal representation of 'e'
# print("Entri", "2023", sep="\n")
# print("Entri", "2023", sep="\b")
# print("Entri", "2023", sep="*", end="\b\b\b\b")
# Exercise 7: Define variables and calculate the sum
# num = 23
# textnum = "57"
# decimal = 98.3

# Print types of variables
# print(type(num))
# print(type(textnum))
# print(type(decimal))
#
# # Calculate sum (converting textnum to integer)
# total_sum = num + int(textnum) + decimal
# print(f"Sum: {total_sum}")
# print(f"Datatype of the sum: {type(total_sum)}")
# Exercise 8: Calculate number of minutes in a year
# days_in_year = 365
# hours_in_day = 24
# minutes_in_hour = 60
#
# # Calculate total minutes in a year
# total_minutes_in_year = days_in_year * hours_in_day * minutes_in_hour
# print(f"The total number of minutes in a year is {total_minutes_in_year}.")
# Exercise 9: Ask the user for their name and greet them
# name = input("achu: ")
# print(f"Hi {name}, welcome to Python programming :)")
# # Exercise 10: Convert pounds to dollars
# pounds = float(input("Please enter amount in pounds: "))
# dollars = pounds * 1.24
# # Example conversion rate
# print(f"Â£{pounds} are ${dollars:.2f}")
